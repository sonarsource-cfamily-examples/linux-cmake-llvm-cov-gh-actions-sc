*This project is analysed on https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=sonarsource-cfamily-examples_linux-cmake-llvm-cov-gh-actions-sc[SonarCloud]!*

:note-caption: :information_source:
NOTE: This simple example ignores https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/languages/c-c-objective-c/#analysis-cache[analysis cache] and https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/languages/c-c-objective-c/#parallel-code-scan[multithreaded execution] both of which can boost analysis significantly.

It is very easy to analyze a C, C++ and Objective-C project with SonarCloud with coverage and https://docs.sonarcloud.io/getting-started/github/[GitHub Actions]:

. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file to store your configuration
. In your `.github/workflows/build.yml` file:
.. Download the https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/ci-based-analysis/sonarscanner-cli/[Sonar Scanner]
.. Download the https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/languages/c-c-objective-c/#analysis-steps-using-build-wrapper[Build Wrapper]
.. Wrap your compilation with the Build Wrapper
* Add the `-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping` compilation flags to instrument the binaries
.. Run the tests to generate the test coverage information
* After each test run, "default.profraw" file will be generated. Make sure to move it someplace, to avoid overwriting with another test run.
.. Merge the coverage information from all test runs and convert the result into a format compatible with llvm-cov using `llvm-profdata merge`
.. Run `llvm-cov show` on all the test executable files (or all object files you are interested in).
* Save the output (the source files annotated with coverage counters) into a file
.. Run `sonar-scanner` as the final step with `sonar.cfamily.llvm-cov.reportPath` pointing to the file with coverage report
. Make sure that you have your token stored as a secret in your repository (`SONAR_TOKEN`). You can request new tokens using https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/[Account/Security page].

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:.github/workflows/build.yml[build.yml] to see it in practice.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
